(*
 * For every n, 10^n has n+1 digits, so it is excluded.
 * For n = 22, 9^22 has only 21 digits. Furthermore when k < 9, k^22 has fewer than 22 digits. So there are no solutions.
 * For n > 22, 9^n has n-1 or fewer digits, so again there are no solutions.

Sum[Floor[(10^n - 1) ^ (1/n)] - Ceiling[(10 ^ (n-1)) ^ (1/n)] + 1, {n, 21}]
