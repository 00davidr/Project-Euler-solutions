Project Euler solutions
=======================

This package contains Nayuki's program code to solve over 183 Project Euler problems.

Each solved problem has a program written in Java. Additionally, some solutions have
Python, Mathematica, and/or Haskell programs. All problems from #1 to #100 are solved.
In some solutions, the source code includes a detailed explanation of the
mathematics involved in order to justify the logic in the program.
