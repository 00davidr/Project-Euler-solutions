(* 
 * In a game of Nim where both players play with perfect strategy, if the current state is a collection (multiset) of piles
 * with sizes {n1, n2, ..., n_m}, then the current player will lose if and only if n1 XOR n2 XOR ... XOR n_m = 0.
 * In this problem, we specialize the condition to just n XOR 2n XOR 3n = 0.
 * 
 * Facts:
 *   3n = 2n + n.
 *   a ^ b = 0 iff a = b. (from digital logic)
 *   a + b = (a ^ b) + ((a & b) << 1). (from digital logic)
 * Hence:
 *   n ^ 2n ^ 3n = 0                          (what we want)
 *   iff n ^ 2n = 3n                          (from the second fact)
 *   iff n ^ 2n = (n ^ 2n) + ((n & 2n) << 1)  (from the third fact)
 *   iff (n & 2n) << 1 = 0                    (by cancelling on both sides)
 *   iff n & 2n = 0                           (left-shifting doesn't change zeroness)
 *   iff the binary representation of n does not have consecutive '1' bits.
